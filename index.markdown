The DutchAUG is a place where Dutch Android professionals can meet and connect with each other on a regular basis. The main goal is to inspire and be inspired by hearing members sharing their knowledge about- and experiences with their passion, Android. We embrace- and make contributions to the Open Source community.

Our meetings are fun and technical, with presentations done by Android gurus, open discussions and demos in an informal setting. The purpose is to provide you "the Android professional" a place to learn more about the Android technology, ask questions and meet other people.

Joining is free!
